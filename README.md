##Personal introduction

I studied **Multilingual Communication** at the University of Geneva and now I am a student at the MA in Multilingual Communication Technology (MATIM).

I am of Russian origin, but I also consider Italian to be my mother tongue because most of my life I have lived in Italy. During my academic career I also studied:

- English
- French
- German 

I have always been attracted by languages and technology, indeed this is what motivated me to attend this Master.
