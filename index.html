					<h3>Personal introduction</h3>
					<p>I studied Multilingual Communication at the University of Geneva and now I am a student at the MA
						in Multilingual Communication Technology (MATIM).</p>
					<p>I am of Russian origin, but I also consider Italian to be my mother tongue because most of my
						life I have lived in Italy. I also studied English, French and German during my academic
						career.</p>
					<p>I have always been attracted by languages and technology, indeed this is what motivated me to
						attend this Master.</p>
